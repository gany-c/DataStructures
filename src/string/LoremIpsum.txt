Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text      of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of      type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
It was popularised in the       1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
and more recently with desktop      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including      versions of Lorem Ipsum.
First, I should make the distinction that "Western Philosophy" will not be fully complimented by a single tradition 
"Eastern Philosophy." The three big non-"Western" traditions of written philosophy will largely be Chinese, Indian, 
and Islamic, and even those will miss a few traditions (like Byzantine, Syriac and the largely 
unwritten by very influential sources of African Philosophy before the Axial Age).
Princeton had this incredible series at one time that included the Source Book for Indian Philosophy edited by 
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and the Source Book for Chinese Philosophy edited by Wing-Tsit Chan. 
These two can be found in a lot of libraries, and are extremely useful for going through selections of primary texts of 
the traditions from long before the chief figures of those traditions up to recent history. 
I cannot recommend them highly enough.
I do have some trouble with what to recommend for Arabic philosophy, 
partly because I haven't found a very good anthology like the two aforementioned source books. 
I have heard good things about Classical Arabic Philosophy: 
An Anthology of Sources edited by Jon McGinnis and David C. Reisman, but haven't read it myself, and it is very expensive. 
I'd like to see what others here would suggest on that front.
Beyond that, I should mention that to fully understand any of these traditions in general, 
it is important to read the whole of the primary texts at length, 
simply because to study any philosophy it is important not only to study the material, summaries, 
or historical contexts but how their ideas are asserted. 
The various scholarly translations of the Buddhist scriptures are often very helpful, 
as are Confucius' Analects (I found Simon Leys' translation incredibly helpful) as well as the Upanishads.
