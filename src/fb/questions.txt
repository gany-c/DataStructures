1. Given a revision system like git, it has a list of checkins / revisions and after some revision things went bad. You are given a function isGood(revision), you have to find out which revision was the source - Did this, was a simple binary search.

2. Given a list of positive and negative integers, push all the zeros to the end - Do this in linear time, without using any additional storage - Got this, but didn't catch edge cases - end already has more that one consecutive zero, adjustment for this pushes the pointer out, and order of conditions while doing these two.

3. I'm given  the prices of a stock for 1 year for each day. Find the best pair of days to buy and sell  - do this in Linear time : totally screwed this up, still don't know the answer.

4. next ...find all permutations of a string ...for e.g. abc has 6 per which aew
abc -> acb 
bac-> bca
cab-> cba

1. Given a list of Strings and 2 words in the List, find the closest separation between those two words 
i.e. they may appear multiple times 

Ans:- linear is possible, as you traverse, compare the 2 latest occurences of w1 and w2, 
compare that separation with saved min

message = "Lets say we are given this very long message. 
We have decided to split this message up ourselves into num_chars chunks. 
Additionally we want to append helpful information at the end of the message telling the client what part of the message this is, so (1/2), (2/2) etc. 
Finally, we need to make sure that we do not break up words when splitting the message. Good luck!"
