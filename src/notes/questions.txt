1. Given a revision system like git, it has a list of checkins / revisions and after some revision things went bad. You are given a function isGood(revision), you have to find out which revision was the source - Did this, was a simple binary search.

2. Given a list of positive and negative integers, push all the zeros to the end - Do this in linear time, without using any additional storage - Got this, but didn't catch edge cases - end already has more that one consecutive zero, adjustment for this pushes the pointer out, and order of conditions while doing these two.

3. I'm given  the prices of a stock for 1 year for each day. Find the best pair of days to buy and sell  - do this in Linear time : totally screwed this up, still don't know the answer.

4. next ...find all permutations of a string ...for e.g. abc has 6 per which aew
abc -> acb 
bac-> bca
cab-> cba

------------------------- linkedin 2016 -----------------------

1. How will you sell Linkedin's premium membership on Walmart? 
What would be the interfaces? 
What requirements, or specifications will you reauest?

2. Why not have a persistent layer at IRO itself? 
How will you fill up this DB?
When will you access or refresh it, if the RTs are the source of truth?

3. Given two sorted lists, with no internal duplicates 
- Create their intersection and union, both should be sorted
- If you use a TreeSet, what will be the complexity? 
- What is a TreeSet's retrieval complexity, 
- What is a TreeSet's inner structure.
- This can be done using merge sort 
- just add a check for equality and update the intersection array, instead of the merge array
- the merge array will form the union array.

4. Given the X and Y coordinates of a set of points, find the maximum number of points which can be fitted on a line
http://www.careercup.com/question?id=1843671

- This can be done in n^2 complexity.
- Solve the problem for each point taking that point as a "must pass" for the line
--- Maintain a map of slope - count of points, return the max from the map
- Get the max of the results from above.

5. Incrementally design a game system

1. Simple Hangman game for 1000 users; no persistence
-- put the session in HttpSession
2. What if you want to see your cummulative score
-- persistence layer, score table
3.  What if you want to see top ranked players in another page
-- Kafka not needed here for offline rank calculation
-- A simple api on the score table, with order by
4.  How would you calculate the user's rank?
-- it will not be in the top 100 or so - calculating rank will be expensive
-- how do you approximate the rank? correlate rank and score and periodically correct the rank?
5. Now, what if you have to load balance this system?
-- Will you create a new table for rank apart from score and constantly update this?
-- What will be the model of the table in nosql
6. Now, what if you want to add friends, and friends rank to the screen?
-- Will you have a friends to friends table and invoke this as a separate ajax API?
-- Will you have a single denormalized table? of friend ranks?

Reverse polish notation, use both stack and string traversal

-- traverse the string, character by character
-- keep pushing operands into stack, 
if you see an operator, pop 2 operands, do the operation. Push back into the stack

1. Given a list of Strings and 2 words in the List, find the closest separation between those two words 
i.e. they may appear multiple times 

Ans:- linear is possible, as you traverse, compare the 2 latest occurences of w1 and w2, 
compare that separation with saved min
