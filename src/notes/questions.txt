In Cassandra, How would you model the schema/backend of a Top Viewed items application
--------------------------------------------------------
MATHEMATICS - GIVEN A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND COIN VALUES, FIND ALL COMBINATIONS	 
MATHEMATICS - RAMANUJAN'S PARTITIONS :)

-------------------- LINKED LIST---------------

 -- find the middle element.
 -- check for cycles

-------------------- RIVER SEA 2015---------------
- You're given a text file of white space delimited words
- Words may be separated by one or more white spaces
- You're asked to compute the following:

- The total number of words in the file
- The frequency of each word
- The top-K most frequently occurring words in the file

- Caveat: You may not use String.split(), Pattern, StringTokenizer, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, etc to split a line of text, i.e., parse the text on your own.

CORE IS IMPLEMENTING THE TOKENIZER - USE 2 INDEXES, INSTEAD GOING ON ADDING.
------------------------------FB 2015-------------------

1. Given a revision system like git, it has a list of checkins / revisions and after some revision things went bad. You are given a function isGood(revision), you have to find out which revision was the source - Did this, was a simple binary search.

2. Given a list of positive and negative integers, push all the zeros to the end - Do this in linear time, without using any additional storage - Got this, but didn't catch edge cases - end already has more that one consecutive zero, adjustment for this pushes the pointer out, and order of conditions while doing these two.

3. I'm given  the prices of a stock for 1 year for each day. Find the best pair of days to buy and sell  - do this in Linear time : totally screwed this up, still don't know the answer.

4. next ...find all permutations of a string ...for e.g. abc has 6 per which aew
abc -> acb 
bac-> bca
cab-> cba

------------------------Apple Oct 2015----------------------------------------------

1. Given a certain number of nodes connected by a linear bus, such that each node has a node on left and right; 
Implement a method that counts the total number of nodes in the system. methods given are 

boolean isLeftMost(); boolean isRightMost(); sendLeft(someMessage); sendRight(someMessage);

to be implemented

main(), receiveLeft(Message m), receiveRight(Message m)

The last two methods are callbacks. 
The same methods should run on every code, and should run when all of the nodes start at the same time

2. Given 2 sets of numbers, how will you find the intersection
-- HashSet approach is what you would use, what if the hashset doesn't fit
--- You may external sort the number lists and then do the check; max - min range of one set can be of help here.

3. Given a huge string that represents a book; write a boolean sentence that returns true if any 2 sentences share a word set
--- This is a simpler variation of the intersection question, in that you just need to find one 
--- How will you do it the hashset doesn't fit.. has to be brute force
--- What if a few false positives are allowed, then how would you do it? Hash a sentence and store in a BloomFilter
--- How will you make a BloomFilter more precise? Increase the size of the underlying byte array.
---- What if the file is distributed - Build bloomfilters on the fly on each node 
and apart from the local check pass messages for checks on other nodes. Add these remote queries to the local bloom filter also.
--- To reduce message passing, you can add batch the messages in terms of 10.

4. How will you store a file of key-value pairs on disks? 

integer - key size
integer -value size
key bytes,
value bytes 
checksum

several of the above in a file and then a file level checksum.

5. How will you create a PeekIterator, which is a wrapper around a regular iterator.

Apart from the hasNext() and next() method you have to implement a peek() method.
You use a temp variable for the method you pulled out - good approach,
but don't use temp==null as a check. That would fail if the iterator itself contains null.

6. How do you speed up external sort with multi core
-- can't do in the merge phase, but you can in the first sort phase.

7. How do you sort numbers across rings? How do you agree on the token ranges? You can use sampling 

------------------------- linkedin 2016 -----------------------

1. How will you sell Linkedin's premium membership on Walmart? 
What would be the interfaces? 
What requirements, or specifications will you reauest?

2. Why not have a persistent layer at IRO itself? 
How will you fill up this DB?
When will you access or refresh it, if the RTs are the source of truth?

2.5. Micro-Services cause a lot of chatter and network latency; why use that model? why not put everything together?
-- If each functionality needs to be scaled independently, why not put everything together and scale up the number of nodes
-- I guess the reason could be that the microservices could have additional clients besides IRO i.e. your aggregator.

-- If there is another level of persistence at the aggregator, how will you sync it with the RTs or Micro Service DBs



3. Given two sorted lists, with no internal duplicates 
- Create their intersection and union, both should be sorted
- If you use a TreeSet, what will be the complexity? 
- What is a TreeSet's retrieval complexity, 
- What is a TreeSet's inner structure.
- This can be done using merge sort 
- just add a check for equality and update the intersection array, instead of the merge array
- the merge array will form the union array.
- If there are a million words, how will you speed up the process?
- If you use multithreading and split the lists into zones, how will you determine where to split 

4. Given the X and Y coordinates of a set of points, find the maximum number of points which can be fitted on a line
http://www.careercup.com/question?id=1843671

- This can be done in n^2 complexity.
- Solve the problem for each point taking that point as a "must pass" for the line
--- Maintain a map of slope - count of points, return the max from the map
- Get the max of the results from above.

5. Incrementally design a game system

1. Simple Hangman game for 1000 users; no persistence
-- put the session in HttpSession
2. What if you want to see your cummulative score
-- persistence layer, score table
3.  What if you want to see top ranked players in another page
-- Kafka not needed here for offline rank calculation
-- A simple api on the score table, with order by
4.  How would you calculate the user's rank?
-- it will not be in the top 100 or so - calculating rank will be expensive
-- how do you approximate the rank? correlate rank and score and periodically correct the rank?
5. Now, what if you have to load balance this system?
-- Will you create a new table for rank apart from score and constantly update this?
-- What will be the model of the table in nosql
6. Now, what if you want to add friends, and friends rank to the screen?
-- Will you have a friends to friends table and invoke this as a separate ajax API?
-- Will you have a single denormalized table? of friend ranks?
7. How will you ensure that people don't see the same games/ words again and again?
-- Use a random number generator?
-- If there are 50,000 words and 10,000 users at a time; How often will a user see repetitions


---------------------- Geometry, points and XY coordinates------------------

1. Given n points, find the Closest pair

--- n^2 checks
Sort by x axis and find the closest neighbor for each point
--- reduce the number of checks by 
1. Don't traverse beyond, the shortest distance already found for that point
2. For a given point, while traversing along the X axis and measuring distances

-- once one neighbor is found, the remaining nodes have to have lower Y separation than that neighbor.

Reverse polish notation, use both stack and string traversal

-- traverse the string, character by character
-- keep pushing operands into stack, 
if you see an operator, pop 2 operands, do the operation. Push back into the stack

Ans:- linear is possible, as you traverse, compare the 2 latest occurences of w1 and w2, 
compare that separation with saved min
